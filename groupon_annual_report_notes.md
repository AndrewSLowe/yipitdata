*"Your goal is to use the attached data file to estimate Groupon’s 4Q13 North America gross billings by segment (Local, Travel, and Goods). Then, using this estimate, make a buy or sell recommendation for Groupon stock, pretending it is January 2014, before Groupon reports 4Q13 earnings in February 2014."*

In other words, I need to analyse the data to give a buy or sell recommendation for groupon 1Q14, based on Groupon's 4Q13 NA gross billings by segment (local, travel, and goods).

focus of our marketing efforts to activating customers and retaining existing customers, rather than customer
acquisition, including through programs such as limited time discounts on purchases and referral incentives." (5)

# Equity research report 1: Deutsche bank

They say *buy*. Groupon exceeded expectations for gross profit and CSOI for 3Q13.
- `gross profit = sales revenue - cost of goods sold`. This measurement makes sense to me, because while the operating fees might tip your profitability to being negative, this measures shows the potential for profit, because if the company scaled up with the same gross profit margin, you could see how they would become profitable. It's largely a measure of efficiency.
- `CSOI (adjusted consolidated segment operating income): operating income - several major expenses`.
